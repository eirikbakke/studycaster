TODO
* Requires Win32 Access
  * Don't capture other windows than Excel when in foreground
  * Strip user names from saved files.
  * Not useful until the above have been implemented
    * Ask for Excel to be closed prior to screencasting (to avoid capturing other Excel documents).
* Ask for permission to screencast
* Dump Java console output to log.
* Have a real progress bar.
* Optimize screencast encoding.
* Don't use a temporary directory that contains the user name in its path.
* Store less IP information (e.g. a shorter hash or a separate file).

Later
* Java screencast.
* Consider real-time screencast uploading.
* Verify timing of videos.
* Find the double-upload bug.
* Sign the JAR.

Done
V Don't reopen; dangerous.
V Have a confirmation dialog if the window is closed before uploading.
V Fix window positioning for all resolutions.

Considered, decided to make no change:
* Add notice about not having to save the document elsewhere.
* Add notice about possibly closed document.

TODO
* Requires Win32 Access
  * Don't capture other windows than Excel when in foreground
  * Strip user names from saved files.
  * Not useful until the above have been implemented
    * Ask for Excel to be closed prior to screencasting (to avoid capturing other Excel documents).
* Requires $$$
  * Add SSL support
  * Sign JAR
* Ask for permission to screencast
* Dump Java console output to log.
* Have a real progress bar.
* Optimize screencast encoding.
* Don't use a temporary directory that contains the user name in its path.
* Store less IP information (e.g. a shorter hash or a separate file).
* Confirm that application does not hang around in Add/Remove programs

Later
* Java screencast.
* Consider real-time screencast uploading.
* Verify timing of videos.
* Find the double-upload bug.
* Sign the JAR.

Done
V Don't reopen; dangerous.
V Have a confirmation dialog if the window is closed before uploading.
V Fix window positioning for all resolutions.

Considered, decided to make no change:
* Add notice about not having to save the document elsewhere.
* Add notice about possibly closed document.

* Renewed logging/screencasting functionality
  * One class queues up stderr/stdout output, mouse pointer movements, log entries, and screenshots.
    These can be queued even before the server has been contacted.
  * Another class intercepts stderr/stdout and the default logger, routing things different places.
  * Another class transmits as soon as the server has been contacted.
  * Philosophy: make the logging entirely independent of the rest, don't require proper shutdown.
* Other notes
  * Might need to send keepalive packets

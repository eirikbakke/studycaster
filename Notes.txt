TODO
* Ask for Excel to be closed prior to screencasting (to avoid capturing other Excel documents).
* Don't capture other windows than Excel when in foreground
* Ask for permission to screencast
* Dump Java console output to log.
* Have a real progress bar.
* Optimize screencast encoding.
* Strip user names from saved files.
* Don't use a temporary directory that contains the user name in its path.
* Store IP prefix in separate file so it's easy to delete it after review.

Later
* Java screencast.
* Consider real-time screencast uploading.
* Verify timing of videos.
* Find the double-upload bug.
* Sign the JAR.

Done
V Don't reopen; dangerous.
V Have a confirmation dialog if the window is closed before uploading.
V Fix window positioning for all resolutions.

Considered, decided to make no change:
* Add notice about not having to save the document elsewhere.
* Add notice about possibly closed document.
